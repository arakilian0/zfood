    /**
     Initialize a `QueryLarge` with member variables.

     - parameter filter: A cacheable query that excludes documents that don't mention the query content. Filter
       searches are better for metadata-type searches and for assessing the concepts in the data set.
     - parameter query: A query search returns all documents in your data set with full enrichments and full text,
       but with the most relevant documents listed first. Use a query search when you want to find the most relevant
       search results.
     - parameter naturalLanguageQuery: A natural language query that returns relevant documents by utilizing training
       data and natural language understanding.
     - parameter passages: A passages query that returns the most relevant passages from the results.
     - parameter aggregation: An aggregation search that returns an exact answer by combining query search with
       filters. Useful for applications to build lists, tables, and time series. For a full list of possible
       aggregations, see the Query reference.
     - parameter count: Number of results to return.
     - parameter returnFields: A comma-separated list of the portion of the document hierarchy to return.
     - parameter offset: The number of query results to skip at the beginning. For example, if the total number of
       results that are returned is 10 and the offset is 8, it returns the last two results.
     - parameter sort: A comma-separated list of fields in the document to sort on. You can optionally specify a sort
       direction by prefixing the field with `-` for descending or `+` for ascending. Ascending is the default sort
       direction if no prefix is specified. This parameter cannot be used in the same query as the **bias** parameter.
     - parameter highlight: When true, a highlight field is returned for each result which contains the fields which
       match the query with `<em></em>` tags around the matching query terms.
     - parameter passagesFields: A comma-separated list of fields that passages are drawn from. If this parameter not
       specified, then all top-level fields are included.
     - parameter passagesCount: The maximum number of passages to return. The search returns fewer passages if the
       requested total is not found. The default is `10`. The maximum is `100`.
     - parameter passagesCharacters: The approximate number of characters that any one passage will have.
     - parameter deduplicate: When `true`, and used with a Watson Discovery News collection, duplicate results (based
       on the contents of the **title** field) are removed. Duplicate comparison is limited to the current query only;
       **offset** is not considered. This parameter is currently Beta functionality.
     - parameter deduplicateField: When specified, duplicate results based on the field specified are removed from
       the returned results. Duplicate comparison is limited to the current query only, **offset** is not considered.
       This parameter is currently Beta functionality.
     - parameter collectionIDs: A comma-separated list of collection IDs to be queried against. Required when
       querying multiple collections, invalid when performing a single collection query.
     - parameter similar: When `true`, results are returned based on their similarity to the document IDs specified
       in the **similar.document_ids** parameter.
     - parameter similarDocumentIDs: A comma-separated list of document IDs to find similar documents.
       **Tip:** Include the **natural_language_query** parameter to expand the scope of the document similarity search
       with the natural language query. Other query parameters, such as **filter** and **query**, are subsequently
       applied and reduce the scope.
     - parameter similarFields: A comma-separated list of field names that are used as a basis for comparison to
       identify similar documents. If not specified, the entire document is used for comparison.
     - parameter bias: Field which the returned results will be biased against. The specified field must be either a
       **date** or **number** format. When a **date** type field is specified returned results are biased towards field
       values closer to the current date. When a **number** type field is specified, returned results are biased towards
       higher field values. This parameter cannot be used in the same query as the **sort** parameter.
